This code applies machine learning algorithms to make predictions. In specific it uses the scikit-learn library and the Random Forest Classifiers provided by the library.
There are 3 applications that this program can be used for.

Applications of the program:
Application 1: For an individual to predict their chances to get lung cancer.
Application 2: For an insurance company to display their insurance premium according to the risk with respect to aquiring lung cancer by the applicant.
Application 3: For a medical researcher to know how effective their method employed to combat cancer is.

All of this is possible due to data fed to the library to learn from it. The training data and testing data for this code for the Random Forest Classifier is divided as 70% and 30% respectively. The algorithm thus shows an accuracy between 85%-95%.
